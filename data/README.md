## Dataset #2: Tree Canopy in Urban and Non-Urban LA county (2014)
This shapefile obtained from the LA County's Open Data consists of a combination of two datasets. The first includes Tree Canopy data for La County from TreePeople/University of Vermont and the second include LA County land cover data using 2014 imagery. Both the these dataset could be overlaid over datasets of schools to see which school in LA county would be most vulnerbale to increased heat due to lack of canopy cover. If possible, using surface heat data would be cgreat to visualize heat island effect in these areas but unsure how to do this.
