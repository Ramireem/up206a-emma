# Emma Ramirez (she/her)
## About Me:
 Hi there! My name is Emma Ramirez and I am a first-year MURP student at UCLA focusing on regional and international development. I'm originally from Pico Rivera, CA but spent most of my adult life in other places. Prior to attending graduate school, I worked as an informal science educator both domestically and abroad, predominantly in outdoor settings. Experiential learning is my jam and I love finding ways to connect communities to their environment. I'm interested in the intersection of sustainable development, environmental justice and community climate resilience/adaptation strategies. During my free time I like going on hikes, cooking, checking out new places.
## Course Description and Objectives:
My understanding of this course is that it will introduce us to the foundations of spatial data science in a step-by-step approach. First starting with learning data science tool, we will then learn the basics of programming through Python which will, in ways, provide us with limitless means to present spatial data without the need of a proprietary program like ESRI. Through this course we will learn the entire process from programming and data searching, to using spatial analysis and geoprocessing tools through Python Libraries using real data that we obtain. My goals in taking this course are as follows:

•	Learn to be more intuitive with how I think of visualizing data spatially.

•	By the end of the course, feel confident in the foundation of using Python as this is my first time doing any form of computer programming.
## Project Ideas:
•	Map sites comparing heat island locations with location of elementary school and further looking at what communities are hit hardest by warming temperatures.

•	Explore which communities are most impacted by the end of moratoriums on water and energy shutoffs.  

•	It would be fun to map the historical movements or changes of neighborhoods, demographically over time.
